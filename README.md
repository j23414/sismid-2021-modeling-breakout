# SISMID 2021: Mathematical Models of Infectious Disease 
## Day 2: Breakout Session on Heterogeneity and Herd Immunity

Kevin C. Ma (kevinchenma@g.harvard.edu)

Before lecture, skim through the paper ["Modeling the impact of racial and ethnic disparities on COVID-19 epidemic dynamics"](https://elifesciences.org/articles/66601). We will run a subset of the models during the breakout session.

During the breakout session, download the following files: [SISMID_Day_2_Breakout_Overview.pdf](https://github.com/kevincma/sismid-2021-modeling-breakout/blob/main/SISMID_Day_2_Breakout_Overview.pdf) walks through the code and contains exercise questions for you to complete in your groups, and [day-2-heterogeneiety-breakout.Rmd](https://github.com/kevincma/sismid-2021-modeling-breakout/blob/main/day-2-heterogeneiety-breakout.Rmd) is the R markdown file with all the code.

Please reach out to the course instructors or TAs if any questions arise!
